# COVID19-Dashboard
This is a project I worked on with several other individuals in December of 2020. This project is hosted publicly and used by the Butler County Health Department of Ohio.

Just after finals had ended, our professor got a few of us students together and asked if we wanted to come together on this project. I, as a sophomore after just completing his senior level course, took the lead.
I delegated tasks and had oversight of the whole project, which we completed and published in just under a week. Since it was published, new groups of students after us have made changes to the public website, but those changes are not reflected in this repo.
